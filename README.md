# Couchbase-Query-Executor-Example

This is an example implementation of [couchbase-query-executor](https://github.com/TeamWanari/couchbase-query-executor/).

## Installation

There is a Maven wrapper pushed to the repository so you can run the project with that file (`mvnw` or `mvnw.cmd`). All you need is to set up a [Couchbase 4.6.1](https://www.couchbase.com/downloads) DB somewhere (even locally, or on a remote server)

You can read more about the library on the [couchbase-query-executor](https://github.com/TeamWanari/couchbase-query-executor/) page.
